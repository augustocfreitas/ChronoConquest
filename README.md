# ChronoConquest - The Timebound Trials

Welcome to the repository of ChronoConquest, an innovative back-end driven game where strategy, time management, and cunning are your tools for victory. As a hero on a quest to defeat the ultimate boss, players must navigate through a series of challenges and enemies, with every action costing precious hours.

## Game Overview

ChronoConquest is a RESTful API-based game designed with TypeScript and powered by NestJS, encapsulating the thrill of adventure games into a back-end service. Each endpoint represents an in-game action that the player can take, such as exploring, battling monsters, resting, and gearing up for the final showdown with the boss.
